# BumperSats

AI-powered satellite collision prevention and debris management using Microsoft Azure.

## Project Overview

Satellite collisions generate hazardous debris that threaten space operations. BumperSats uses AI and Azure cloud services to detect debris, forecast collision risks, and autonomously plan satellite maneuvers to ensure safe and sustainable space traffic management.

## Features

- Debris detection using deep learning  
- Collision forecasting with physics-informed models  
- Autonomous maneuver planning via reinforcement learning  
- Real-time data ingestion and processing on Azure  
- Operator coordination through blockchain technology  
- Responsible AI principles integrated throughout

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+  
- Azure CLI  
- Access to Azure subscription

### Installation

  pip install -r requirements.txt


### Usage

Instructions to run detection models, forecasting scripts, and deployment steps will be added here.
